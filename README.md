# 33_days_of_Machine_Learning

Welcome to 33_days_of_Machine_Learning, a personal journey of rediscovering and deepening my understanding of machine learning over 33 days. This repository is a living document where I will share daily updates, insights, and learnings as I explore various aspects of machine learning, both foundational and advanced.

## What to Expect:
- <b>Daily Reflections</b>: Each day, I will document my experiences, thoughts, and any new knowledge or techniques I acquire. This may include notes, code snippets, and reflections on what I've learned.
- <b>Hands-On Practice</b>: Code examples and exercises that illustrate the concepts I'm studying. These will be implemented in Jupyter notebooks and shared within the repository.
- <b>Progress Tracking</b>: Regular updates on my progress, challenges faced, and milestones achieved throughout the journey.
- <b>Resource Sharing</b>: Links to articles, books, tutorials, and other resources that I find valuable during my exploration.

## Daily Details
